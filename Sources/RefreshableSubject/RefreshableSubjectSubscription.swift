/** 
	A concrete subscription used by `RefreshableSubject`.

	This subscription holds a reference to both publisher and subscriber, so that published
	data can be pushed downstream to the subscriber, and manual refresh calls can be pushed upstream
	to the `RefreshableSubject`.

	Generally there is no need to interact directly with this class and its subject holds a private
	reference to it. `RefreshableSubject` flows should be customized by implementing a `Refreshable`â€“conforming service above it, a custom subsciber beneath
	it, or both.
